# EmailEncryptionProject
A Java-based project for encrypting, hiding, and retrieving files securely using MySQL.


## Overview
This project implements encryption algorithms and demonstrates their functionality using various encryption techniques such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The goal is to create a robust solution for secure data transmission and storage.

## Features
- Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES, DES)
- Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA)
- File encryption and decryption
- Key management and generation
- User interface for easy encryption/decryption tasks
- Support for various file formats

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java (or your chosen language)
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** 
  - [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) (for cryptographic algorithms) 
  - [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-cryptography-extension-jce.html)
- **Tools:** 
  - Eclipse (IDE)
  - GitHub for version control
  - Maven/Gradle (if used)

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Install **Java** (version 8 or higher).
2. Install an IDE like **Eclipse** or **IntelliJ IDEA**.
